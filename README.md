## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Professional Architecture

This project was engineered using professional best practices to demonstrate readiness for a developer role.

* **Architecture:**
    * **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):** A clean separation between the UI (View), app logic (ViewModel), and data (Model), making the code scalable, testable, and maintainable.
    * **Repository Pattern:** ViewModels communicate with a central `BusinessRepository`, which acts as the **"Single Source of Truth"** for all app data‚Äîa critical professional pattern that decouples data sources from the UI logic.

* **Modern Tech Stack:**
    * **UI:** Built entirely with **Jetpack Compose**, the modern, declarative UI toolkit for Android.
    * **Networking:** Uses **Retrofit** to communicate with a live API (a GitHub Gist) to fetch and parse JSON data.
    * **Database:** Integrated a **Room Database** for local data persistence, enabling offline access and powering the favorites system.
    * **Asynchronous Programming:** All network and database operations are handled efficiently in the background using **Kotlin Coroutines and Flow**, ensuring the app's UI never freezes.
    * **Navigation:** Implemented a robust, multi-screen architecture using **Compose Navigation**.

## üöÄ The Development Journey

This project's development was a realistic engineering journey that required overcoming numerous real-world obstacles, including:
* Resolving stubborn IDE caching bugs that required invalidating caches and performing clean builds.
* Debugging silent data loading failures caused by database schema mismatches and race conditions.
* Diagnosing and fixing broken API links and JSON syntax errors using `Logcat` and detailed error analysis.

Successfully navigating these challenges was a critical part of the process, proving my ability to debug, problem-solve, and build a stable, resilient application..
